        Let's start with some practice trials.  First you will see two objects appear on the screen, and a speaker will name one of the objects. After the speaker names the object, you will be prompted to type the word you just heard.
        <br>
        <br>
        You will then see two more objects; again a speaker will name one of them, and you will be prompted to type what you just heard.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, you will see three objects appear on the screen.  The speaker will ask you to find one of the objects.  Please select the object that the speaker names by clicking on it.  The task will automatically proceed to the next trial.

        Great! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now you will do the same task, but with unfamiliar objects and words.  First you will see two objects appear on the screen, and a speaker will name one of the objects. After the speaker names the object, you will be prompted to type the word you just heard (don't worry about the spelling - just give us your best guess!). 
        <br>
        <br>
        You will then see two more objects, and again a speaker will name one of them. After the speaker names one of the items, please type the name you just heard.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, you will see three objects appear on the screen.  The speaker will ask you to find one of the objects.  Your job is to select the object that you think the speaker is referring to.  Select the object by clicking on it. The task will automatically proceed to the next trial.
